#type casting= convert the data type of a  value to another data type.
#Cannot perform maths on strings
x=1 #int
y=2.0 #float
z="5"#str

#changing y from float to interger
y= int(y)

#Z is a string but we take numeric value and mutiple it by 3 so 15 thats how u type cast
z= int(z)

#Basically String and we change the int into a string so it can print
print("X is "+str(x))
print(y)
print(z*3)
